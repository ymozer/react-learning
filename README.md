Define goals of website and goals:
I think most important thing for designing or building web site (or anthing), developer should fully understand projects ideas, goals, who is the target audience, what are this project trying to achieve. After that developer can create what he/she wants. This is improving vision for the project and developer keep going with brainstorming on that subject.

Developer purpose is achieving "why". If developer don't have a clear idea about what he is doing, than there is no point. 

"problem, solution and market"
